# unilookup

A simple CLI Python 3 utility for looking up unicode codepoints.

Simply run `unilookup` and send the data you wish to look up through stdin, and it'll spit out a nice ASCII table.

Originally based on https://github.com/miestasmia/unilookup. Ported to Python 3 there wasn't much left of the origin code thanks to Python 3's built-in unicodedata library.
