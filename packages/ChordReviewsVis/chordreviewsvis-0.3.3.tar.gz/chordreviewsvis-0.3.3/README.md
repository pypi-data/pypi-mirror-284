# Chord Reviews

## Overview
`ChordReviewsVis` is a Python package designed to process and visualize review data by generating chord plots. These visualizations illustrate word co-occurrence patterns and sentiment analysis, providing insights into the textual data. For this, the visualization relies on the following features:
- **Labels for each node:** The top nouns and adjectives extracted from the reviews were displayed around the graphic.
- **Label bars:** Below the labels, there is a bar whose color illustrates the words' overall frequency in reviews. The darker the color, the more frequent the word.
- **Edges:** The line connecting the words that occur together.
- **Edge thickness:** This characteristic shows how often the connected words appear in the same sentence. The more often they are together, the thicker the line is.
- **Edge color:** The color shows the overall sentiment of the words that are being connected. Red was used for negative sentiments, blue for neutral ones, and green for positive sentiments.

This package was developed by Felix Jose Funes as part of his master's dissertation at NOVA Information Management School (NOVA IMS), Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal, which was supervised by Prof. Nuno Antonio, PhD.

## Installation
To install `ChordReviewsVis`, use pip:
```
pip install ChordReviewsVis
```

## Usage
First, import the necessary libraries and the `ChordReviews` function:
```
import pandas as pd
from ChordReviewsVis import ChordReviews
```

Prepare the DataFrame with a text column containing review data. Then call the `ChordReviews` function:
```
# Load DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv("filepath")

# Generate chord plot
ChordReviews(df, 'review')
```

Some datasets that can be used for this purpose are:

* [IMDB Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulanandjha/imdb-50k-movie-reviews-test-your-bert)
* [Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews)
* [Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)

## Function Parameters
- **df** (pandas.DataFrame): DataFrame containing review data.
- **text_column** (str): Name of the column containing the text data.
- **size** (int, optional): Size of the output chord plot. Default is 300.
- **stopwords_to_add** (list, optional): Additional stopwords to include in the stop words set. Default is an empty list.
- **stemming** (bool, optional): Whether to apply stemming to words. Default is False.
- **lemmatization** (bool, optional): Whether to apply lemmatization to words. Default is True.
- **words_to_replace** (dict, optional): A dictionary where keys are words to be replaced and values are the replacements. Default is an empty dictionary.
- **label_text_font_size** (int, optional): Font size for the labels in the chord plot. Default is 12.

## Returns
- **hv.Chord**: A chord plot visualization of word co-occurrence patterns and sentiment analysis.

## Examples 
### Basic Usage
```
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from ChordReviewsVis import ChordReviews

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/felix-funes/ChordReviewsVis/raw/main/Test%20Dataset%20-%20IMDB%20Movie%20Reviews.csv")

# Generate chord plot
ChordReviews(df, 'review')

```

### Custom Parameters

Though lemmatization is used by default, users have the possibility of using stemming.
```
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from ChordReviewsVis import ChordReviews

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/felix-funes/ChordReviewsVis/raw/main/Test%20Dataset%20-%20IMDB%20Movie%20Reviews.csv")

# Generate chord plot
ChordReviews(df, 'review', stemming=True, lemmatization=False)

```
![Chord plot example with stemming](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felix-funes/ChordReviewsVis/7b50f84045ddb126ba2a6fe5d036e86b23325625/Sample%20Chord%20Plot%20-%20IMDB%20Dataset%20-%20Stemming.svg)

To refine the visualization, it is possible to use the "stopwords_to_add" parameter to remove irrelevant words and "words_to_replace" to unify terms with the same meaning.

```
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from ChordReviewsVis import ChordReviews

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/felix-funes/ChordReviewsVis/raw/main/Test%20Dataset%20-%20IMDB%20Movie%20Reviews.csv")

# Generate chord plot
chord_reviews(df, 'Review', stemming=False, lemmatization=True, stopwords_to_add=["wa", "ha"], words_to_replace={"movie": "film"})
```

Because of the prevalence of the words "film" and "movie", they may be considered stop words. It is possible to remove them using the parameter "stopwords_to_add". For presentation purposes, the final plot and label text can be resized.
```
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from ChordReviewsVis import ChordReviews

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/felix-funes/ChordReviewsVis/raw/main/Test%20Dataset%20-%20IMDB%20Movie%20Reviews.csv")

# Generate chord plot
chord_reviews(df, 'Review', stemming=False, lemmatization=True, stopwords_to_add=["wa", "ha", "movie", "film"], label_text_font_size=13, size=400)

```
