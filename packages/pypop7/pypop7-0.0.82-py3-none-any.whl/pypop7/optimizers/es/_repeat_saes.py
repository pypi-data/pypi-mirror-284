"""Repeat the following paper for `SAES`:
    Beyer, H.G., 2020, July.
    Design principles for matrix adaptation evolution strategies.
    In Proceedings of Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Companion (pp. 682-700). ACM.

    Luckily our Python code could repeat the data reported in the original Matlab code (as shown below) *well*.
    Therefore, we argue that its repeatability could be **well-documented**.

    The following Matlab code comes from https://homepages.fhv.at/hgb/downloads/mu_mu_I_lambda-ES.oct
      with only slight modifications:
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % This is a simple Octave implementation of the (mu/mu_I, lambda)-sigmaSA-ES
    % as discussed in
    % http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Evolution_Strategies
    % Note, if you want to use this in Matlab, you have to copy each function
    % definition in a separate m-file.
    % The code presented below should be regarded as a skeleton only

    mu = 3;                 % number of parents
    lambda = 12;            % number of offspring
    yInit = ones(30,1);     % initial parent vector
    sigmaInit = 1;          % initial global mutation strength sigma
    sigmaMin = 1e-10;       % ES stops when sigma is smaller than sigmaMin

    % initialization:
    n = length(yInit);      % determine search space dimensionality n
    tau = 1/sqrt(2*n);      % self-adaptation learning rate
    % initializing individual population:
    Individual.y = yInit;
    Individual.sigma = sigmaInit;
    Individual.F = fitness(Individual.y);
    for i=1:mu; ParentPop{i} = Individual; end
