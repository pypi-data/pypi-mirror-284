Neural Geometry is a Python library designed to explore and manipulate the geometric properties of neural network latent spaces. It provides a set of tools and methods to understand the complex, high-dimensional spaces that neural networks operate in, inspired by recent approaches (e.g. Borde et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04810.pdf)).


The primary features of Neural Geometry include:

- An implementation of the neural latent geometry search framework. This framework provides a unique approach to product manifold inference, which can be beneficial in various fields such as machine learning and data analysis.
- A selection of optimization methods to cater to different needs and requirements. These methods can be used to fine-tune the performance of the neural latent geometry search framework.

This package is designed to be compatible with popular scientific computing libraries such as NumPy and PyTorch, making it a versatile tool for researchers and developers working in these environments. Comprehensive documentation is available at [docs](https://ae-bii.github.io/neural-geometry/).
