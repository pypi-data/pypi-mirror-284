- 💩 Why is it _stupid_?
  - Because it just uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). Nothing fancy.
  - That is our core design choice. We want something _stupid simple_, yet _reasonably fast_.

- 🧠 Is it possibly... _smart_ in any way though?
  - Maybe.
  - **It will squeeze the most juice from your machine: 🍊**
     - Optimized SQL
     - Cache-friendly memory access
     - Fast in the places that matter 🚀
     - All with a simple Python interface

## Overview

SVS is stupid yet can handle a million documents on commodity hardware, so it's probably perfect for you.

**Should you use SVS?** SVS is designed for the use-case where:
 1. you have less than a million documents, and
 2. you don't add/remove documents very often.

If that's you, then SVS will probably be the simples (and _stupidest_) way to manage your document vectors!

## Quickstart

TODO

## Debug Logging

This library logs using Python's builtin `logging` module. It logs mostly to `INFO`, so here's a snippet of code you can put in _your_ app to see those traces:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
)

# ... now use SVS as you normally would, but you'll see extra log traces!
```
