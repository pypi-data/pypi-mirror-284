# SAM CLI: Vulnerability Analyzer for Lua Smart Contracts

**SAM CLI** is a powerful tool designed to assist developers in identifying vulnerabilities within Lua smart contracts. Leveraging static analysis techniques, SAM CLI detects potential security issues that could compromise the integrity and functionality of smart contracts.

## Steps to Use SAM CLI

1. **Clone the SAM CLI Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishvsoni/sam-cli
   cd sam-cli
Analyze Lua Smart Contracts

Use SAM CLI to analyze your Lua smart contract file (filepath.lua). Replace filepath.lua with the path to your Lua code file.

bash
Copy code
sam filepath.lua --generate-report
This command performs static analysis on the specified Lua smart contract file and generates a detailed vulnerability report in HTML format (report.html).

Viewing the Report
After running the analysis command, locate the generated report.html file in the current directory. Open this file in a web browser to view comprehensive details about identified vulnerabilities within your Lua smart contract.

Key Features of SAM CLI
Static Analysis: Identifies potential vulnerabilities such as integer overflow, reentrancy issues, denial of service risks, and more.
Customizable Reporting: Generates detailed reports (report.html) that highlight vulnerabilities based on severity levels.
Integration: Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines or used locally to ensure smart contract security before deployment.
Example Usage
Assume filepath.lua contains Lua code for a smart contract. Running SAM CLI helps in preemptively identifying and addressing security concerns, thereby enhancing the overall reliability and trustworthiness of your smart contract applications.

Conclusion
By using SAM CLI, developers can proactively mitigate risks associated with smart contract vulnerabilities, ensuring robust security practices in blockchain and decentralized application (dApp) development.
