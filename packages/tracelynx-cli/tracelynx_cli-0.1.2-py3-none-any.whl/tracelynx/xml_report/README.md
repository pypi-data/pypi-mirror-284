# Usage

To use the library, you can create a script or run it directly from the command line:

python my_xml_library/xml_processor.py inputFiles/reports ./out.xml

This setup provides a basic structure for processing multiple XML files and creating a new XML file. The logic for creating and merging the XML content will be added in the process_xml_files function.
