# Core Concept

`@block`-decorator and `Flow`-class is important.
`@block` automatically generates input and output functions, allowing you to focus solely on the processing.
`Flow` allows you to focus solely on the process flow and input parameters.

## About `@block`-decorator

simple decorator is like below.

```python
def simple_decorator(func):
    def wrap_func() -> str:
        res = func()
        return f"Hello, {res}"
    return wrap_func


@simple_decorator
def world() -> str:
    return "world"


world()  # => "Hello, world"
```

A `decorator` is something that dynamically generates and adds processes to functions or classes, similar to its name.


First, prepare a function as follows and decorate it with `@block`.

```python
from kabutobashi import block

@block()
class UdfBlock:
    term: int = 10

    def _process(self):
        return {"doubled_term": self.term * 2}
```

The classes above is equivalent to the following class definition.

```python
import pandas as pd
from kabutobashi.domain.entity.blocks import BlockGlue

class UdfBlock:
    series: pd.DataFrame = None
    params: dict = None
    term: int = 10
    block_name: str = "udf_block"

    def _process(self):
        return {"doubled_term": self.term * 2}
    
    def process(self):
        return self._process()

    def factory(self, glue: BlockGlue) -> "UdfBlock":
        # Omitted. In reality, processes are described.
        ...

    def _factory(self, glue: BlockGlue) -> "UdfBlock":
        # Omitted. In reality, processes are described.
        ...

    def glue(self, glue: BlockGlue) -> BlockGlue:
        # Omitted. In reality, processes are described.
        ...

```

In classes decorated with `@block`, it is not recommended to execute the `__init__()` method. Instead, it is recommended to use the `factory()` class-method.

`factory()` method description.
`process()` method description.
`glue()` method description.


Up to this point, the use of the `@block` decorator with classes such as UdfClass has described, but using the Block class on its own is not intended. Please read the following explanation of the `Flow` class for more details.

### Read-Block

- input
  - params
- output
  - series

### Crawl-Block

- input
  - params
- output
  - output.params

### Extract-Block

- input
  - params
- output
  - output.params

### PreProcess-Block

- input
  - series
  - params
- output
  - series

### Process-Block

- input
  - series
  - params
- output
  - output.series

### Parameterize-Block

- input
  - series
  - params
- output
  - output.params

### Reduce-Block

- input
  - series
  - params
- output
  - params

## About `Flow`-class

> Blocks are meant to be combined.

Processes always consist of combinations of multiple simple operations. And the only tedious part is aligning their inputs and outputs.

Therefore, in `Flow`-class, it automatically resolves the sequence of those processes for users, as long as you provide the initial values.

## usage

```python
import kabutobashi as kb

# n日前までの営業日の日付リストを取得する関数
target_date = "2020-01-01"
date_list = kb.get_past_n_days(target_date, n=40)
```

## initialize Database

```python
import kabutobashi as kb
kb.KabutobashiDatabase().initialize()

# add data
kb.crawl_info_multiple(code="1375", page="1")
kb.crawl_info_multiple(code="1375", page="2")
kb.crawl_info_multiple(code="1375", page="etc...")

# add data daily
kb.crawl_info(code="1375")

# analysis and add data
kb.analysis(code="1375")
```
