    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The anomaly-detection process begins with sampling equal-sized GONG H-Alpha solar observation anomalous and non-anomalous images, followed by partitioning each image into an n √ó n grid. This grid superimposes on the image, dividing it into n¬≤ cells. Each cell's average pixel intensity is computed, effectively downsampling the image to a grid of average values. Users can then choose between two methods, 'minmax' or 'anova', to establish a normal intensity range for each cell. The 'minmax' approach utilizes labeled normal data to determine the optimal cell ranges based on the minimum and maximum pixel average values across non-anomalous images. Alternatively, the 'anova' approach employs a one-way ANOVA F-test to statistically analyze the two groups of classified data, refining the normal intensity range for each cell. This step optimizes upper and lower bounds for each cell's intensity using the statistic ùëÜ = ‚à£ùëà ‚àí ùêº‚à£ + ‚à£ùêø ‚àí ùêº‚à£, where ùëà and ùêø are candidate upper and lower bounds, and ùêº is the cell's average intensity. This ensures accurate detection of cells with significantly deviant pixel intensities. A cell is flagged as anomalous if its Sigmoid-transformed standardized S statistic value exceeds a specified threshold. Furthermore, an entire image is classified as anomalous if it surpasses a predefined minimum number of corrupt cells."

    "#### Compute Best Range for Each Cell Using ANOVA or MinMax\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell creates an instance of the Anomalyzer class to processes the sampled images by reading them in grayscale, dividing them into a grid of cells and calculating their average pixel values. It then computes the optimal upper and lower range values for each grid cell using the sampled anomalous and non-anomalous paths. The `method` argument determines whether the `anova` or `minmax` method is used to establish normal pixel average ranges per cell. When using the `anova` method, additional parameters like `lower_range_end`, `upper_range_start`, and `step_size` can be specified to define candidate ranges for the One-way ANOVA F-test. It's important to consider two points: First, executing this cell takes approximately 10 minutes with 40 sampled images, when using the `anova` method, on a typical personal computer. Second, ensuring the sampled images include at least one image with issues in all four corners prevents the F-statistic from becoming undefined (returns `nan` and raises a `ConstantInputWarning`) due to constant average pixel values (e.g., 0.0) in those cells. Any `nan` F-statistics resulting from undefined calculations are handled by replacing them with a unique value (i.e. -1), ensuring accurate ranking of candidate ranges based on F-statistics."
