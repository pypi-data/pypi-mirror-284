# Django Gateway Interface

## Overview

**Django Gateway Interface** is a Django application designed to provide a user-friendly web interface for configuring Nginx settings. This package enables users to easily manage gateway configurations, specifically to set request limits and block IP addresses at any endpoint for security purposes. It supports both Windows and Linux environments, allowing for seamless integration and efficient configuration management based on user input.

** Make sure you have installed a nginx

## Features

- User-friendly interface for gateway configuration.
- Integration with Nginx to apply and manage configurations.
- Easy installation via PyPI.

## Installation

You can install the Django Gateway Interface package from PyPI using pip. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher and Django 3.0 or higher installed.

```bash
pip install gateapp
```


## Configuration
Add to Installed Apps:
Add 'gateway_interface' to your INSTALLED_APPS in your Django settings.py:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Other installed apps

]
```
**Nginx Configuration:**
Configure Nginx to serve your Django application. Hereâ€™s a basic Nginx configuration example for windows:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /static/ {
        alias /path/to/your/static/files/;
    }

    location /media/ {
        alias /path/to/your/media/files/;
    }
}
```
Replace yourdomain.com and file paths with your specific details.
