    This function approximates the area under the curve,
    by computing the Y-values at evenly spaced points on the X-axis between ``[range[0], range[1]]``
    and then computing the average of these values.
    The cocoapi_ uses this method to compute the Average Precision of their smoothed PR-curves.

    While not completely equivalent, this method can be thought of as some kind of Riemann sum.
    A Riemann sum boils down to approximating a curve with rectangles (of equal width).
    The `side` argument defines which value to take for the height of each rectangle.
    Since our curves are made up of sparse points (as opposed to a continuous function),
    we cannot really compute a midpoint Riemann sum.

       Figure from `khan academy`_

    It is generally recommended to use a right Riemann sum for decreasing functions (eg. PR)
    and a left Riemann sum for increasing functions (eg. ROC),
    as this results in your approximated AUC value to be slightly underestimated,
    as opposed to being overestimated.

    Args:
        curve (pandas.DataFrame): dataframe containing the X- and Y-values of the curve
        x (string): Name of the column that holds the X-axis values; Default **None**
        y (string): Name of the column that holds the Y-axis values; Default **None**
        samples (number): Number of equally spaced samples to take on the X-axis; Default **101**
        range (2 numbers): Starting and stopping point for the AUC on the X-axis (inclusive); Default **[0,1]**
        side ('left' | 'right'): Whether to compute a left or right Riemann sum; Default **right**

    Returns:
        Number: Approximated area under the curve

    Note:
        If you do not give this function an X and/or Y column,
        it will default to using ``columns[0]`` as Y and ``columns[1]`` as X. |br|
        The default curves in brambox (eg. PR, MRFPPI) do follow this convention.

    Note:
        As stated above, this function is not exactly the same as computing a Riemann sum with equal width rectangles. |br|
        In this function, we interpolate the values with N points and compute the average of these points.
        A Riemann sum averages a curve with rectangles and N points would only generate N-1 rectangles. |br|
        This is expected behaviour, as the goal of this function is not to generate a perfect Riemann sum,
        but rather to get as close as the cocoapi as possible.
