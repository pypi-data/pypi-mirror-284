"""
This module provides a class for analyzing treatment effects in medical records.

The TreatmentEffect class facilitates the analysis of treatment effects over time or
across different patient groups. It allows users to identify patients who underwent
treatment and experienced outcomes, and find a control group with similar criteria but
without undergoing the treatment. The class supports customizable criteria filtering,
time constraints between treatment and outcome, and optional matching of control groups
to treatment groups using a specified matching class.
