# `xdevs.py`

Version of the xDEVS simulator for Python projects

The aim of this repository is to be able to simulate DEVS systems in both virtual and real-time environments using python. 
However, additional features are being developed.

## Sections
1. [Quick Start](#quick-start)
2. [What to Expect](#what-to-expect)
3. [DEVS in a Nutshell](#devs-in-a-nutshell)
4. [Deepening the repository](#deepening-the-repository)


## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
````text
git clone https://github.com/iscar-ucm/xdevs.py.git
````
2. Navigate to the project directory
```text
cd xdevs
```
3. Install the package
```text
pip install .
```

**Now you're ready to start using xDEVS.py for your DEVS simulations!**

In case additional dependencies (`sql`, `elasticsearch` or `mqtt`) are required, they can be installed. 
To add MQTT support with paho-mqtt: 
```text
pip install .[mqtt]
```


## What to Expect

This section summarizes what you may find in the repository folder structure.

* ### Folder abc: 
    * The abstract classes folder contains the handler and transducer files. These folders contain the classes that define the general behavior and structure that each I/O handler or Transducer must follow. 

* ### Folder celldevs:
    * Contains the implementation of CellDEVS.

* ### Folder examples

    * Inside this folder, you will find a collection of examples to try and execute in both virtual and wall-clock simulations. Each sub-folder represents an independent case study:
      - CellDevs
      - Devstone
      - Gpt
      - Json
      - Store


* ### Folder plugins

    * This folder encapsulates a collection of folders. Each subfolder stores the implementations of each of the abstract classes.  For example, in the `input_handlers` subfolder, you will find several implementations for the Input Handler.

* ### Folder tests

    * This folder is dedicated to storing the tests for GitHub Actions.

* ### Factory.py

    * This script is in charge of creating the different types of implementations of an abstract class based on a key that is linked to the desired implementation.

* ### Models.py

    * It has the basic `DEVS` models such as `Atomic`, `Coupled` `Component`, or `Port`.

* ### Rt.py

    * It has the adaptation of the `sim.py` components to the real-time simulation methodology developed.

* ### Sim.py

    * It has the `DEVS` components to carry out a simulation based on the abstract simulator mechanism.

## DEVS in a Nutshell

Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) is a mathematical formalism with modular and hierarchical characteristics. DEVS is based on discrete event simulation where events occur chronologically in discrete instants of time and result in a change of the system.

DEVS is mainly based on atomic and coupled models.

### Atomic Model

An atomic model is the smallest representation of a system. It may remain in a state (S) for a certain time (ta); once the time has passed, it executes the internal transition function (`deltint`). This function will define what to do next for each state. However, if during that time something external occurs, the model reacts with its external transition function (`deltext`) that describes what to do in this case. If the external event occurs at the same time the `ta` has elapsed, the confluent transition function (`deltcon`) defines what to do next. Finally, the output function (`lambdaf`) defines for each state what should be done when transitioning between states. It is only executed after the internal transition function.

### Coupled Model

A coupled model defines the connections among atomic models and other coupled models.

### Simulation Mechanism

To simulate a system composed of atomic and coupled models, the abstract simulator mechanism is used. This methodology defines the simulators and coordinators. A simulator is attached to an atomic model, while the coordinator is attached to a coupled model. The coordinator will be in charge of carrying out the simulation.

Refer to the xDEVS userâ€™s manual for further and deeper understanding [here](https://iscar-ucm.github.io/xdevs/).


## xDEVS.py Wall-clock Simulation

A real-time simulation intends to match the virtual time into a wall-clock time. The methodology followed in this repository to achieve the real-time behaviour is based on the arrival of external events. The system will remain waiting for external events between states, when an external event occurs the system will react according to its particular behaviour.  

In this repository, a `RealTimeManager` and a `RealTimeCoordinator` must be combined to achieve a wall-clock simulation. In addition, if the system requires the handling of input and output events, the `input_handler` and `output_handler` will be used.

### System overview

The next picture shows the system overview and how the different components interact with each other

![System Overview](xdevs/images/sysoverview_small.png
)
1. The `input_handler` acts are the interface for any incoming event to the system sending it to the `RealTimeManager`. 
2. The `RealTimeCoordinator` send the events collected from the `RealTimeManager` to the `DEVS` model. 
3. The `DEVS` model may eject events out of the system, so they are routed to the `RealTimeManager`. 
4. Finally, those outgoing events are forwarded to the `output_handler` which act as an interface to send the events.
