# Shapley Hierarchical Models

'shaplyh' is an extremely fast implementation of OpenAI's hierarchical shapley trees.
We've implemented a small, modular footprint allowing users to build on top of already staged structures, which is particularly effective for interactive client facing tools.
This project is under active development with nightly uploads. (release < *.*.10 can be considered stable, containing no new features or breaking changes, only bug fixes).

Comprehensive docs imminent.
