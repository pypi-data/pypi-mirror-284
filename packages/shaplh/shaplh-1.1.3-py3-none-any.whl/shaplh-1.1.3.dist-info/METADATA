# Shapley Hierarchical Models

'shaplyh' is an extremely fast implementation of OpenAI's hierarchical shapley trees. 
We've implemented a small modular footprint allowing users to build on top of already staged structures. This is particularly effective for interactive client facing tools.
This is under active development with nightly builds uploaded.
