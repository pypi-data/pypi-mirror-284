    This class wraps multiple message-processing (logging and / or printing) backends and provides an API that allows
    configuring and using the wrapped backend in a consistent fashion across many projects. Overall, it is designed to
    largely behave like the standard 'print()' and 'raise' methods offered by the default Python library.

    Notes:
        Since this class is explicitly designed to be shared by multiple projects that may also be mutually-dependent,
        it defaults to a disabled state. When Console is initialized, calling its echo() (analogous to print()) method
        will not produce any output and calling error() (analogous to raise) method will behave like a standard
        'raise' method. To enable the full class functionality, the Console has to be configured (via add_handles() and
        enabled (via enable()) methods.

        Do not configure or enable the Console class from libraries that may be imported by other projects! To work
        properly, the Console has to be enabled at the highest level of the call hierarchy: from the main runtime
        script. Leave console configuration and enabling to the end-user.

    Args:
        logger_backend: Specifies the backend used to process message and error terminal-printing and file-logging.

            LOGURU and CLICK.

            width of the text block as it is displayed in the terminal and written to log files.
        debug_log_path: The path to the file used to log debug messages (messages at or below DEBUG level). If not
            provided (set to None), logging debug messages will be disabled.
        message_log_path: The path to the file used to log non-error messages (INFO through WARNING levels). If not
            provided (set to None), logging non-debug messages will be disabled.

        break_long_words: Determines whether to break long words when formatting the text block to fit the width

        break_on_hyphens: Determines whether to break sentences on hyphens when formatting the text block to fit the
            width requirement.

        existing handles.

        This method is only used when Console uses 'loguru' backend. It has no effect for other backends.

        The handles control which messages (levels) can be processed and where they are sent (terminal, file, or both).
        This method adds two separate handles to save messages to files and print them to the terminal
        for each of the 3 supported level categories: at or below DEBUG, INFO through WARNING, and at or above ERROR.
        Overall, this means the method can add up to 6 handles.

        This method only needs to be called once and only from the highest level of the call hierarchy, such as the
        main runtime script or module. Do not call this method from libraries designed to be used in other projects to
        avoid interfering with upstream processes instantiating their own handles.

        Notes:
            The method can be flexibly configured to only add a subset of all supported handles. For example,
            by default, it does not add debug handles, making it impossible to terminal-print or file-log debug
            messages. It can also be configured to not remove existing handles (default behavior) if necessary. See
            argument docstrings below for more information.

            During runtime, handles determine what happens to the message passed via the appropriate 'log' call. Loguru
            shares the set of handles across all 'logger' instances, which means this method should be used with
            caution, as it can interfere with any other handles, including the default ones.

        Args:
            remove_existing_handles: Determines whether to remove all existing handles before adding new loguru handles.
                Since loguru comes with 'default' handles enabled, this is almost always the recommended option.
            debug_terminal: Determines whether to add the handle that prints messages at or below DEBUG level to
                terminal.
            debug_file: Determines whether to add the handle that writes messages at or below DEBUG level to debug-log
                file.
            message_terminal: Same as debug_terminal, but for messages at INFO through WARNING levels.

            error_terminal: Same as debug_terminal, but for messages at or above ERROR level.
            error_file: Same as debug_file, but for messages at or above ERROR level.
            enqueue: Determines if messages are processed synchronously or asynchronously. Generally, this option is
                only suggested for multiprocessing runtimes that handle messages from multiple processes, as queueing
                messages prevents common multiprocessing / multithreading issues such as race conditions.
