# Project 66 Tiny Circuit

Produced with `circuit-build`, using the `tests/functional/data/proj66-tiny` data as a
base.

The file `nodes.h5` contains all fields generated by `circuit-build` version 4.0.1.
The other file, `nodes_small.h5`, contains only a minimal set of attributes to test
loading a partial node file.
