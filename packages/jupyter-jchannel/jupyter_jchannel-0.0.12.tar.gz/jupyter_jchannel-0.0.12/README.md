**Simple communication framework to call JavaScript frontend code from Python
kernel code and vice-versa in Jupyter Notebooks. Supports asynchronous and
synchronous retrieval of results and wrapping of frontend exceptions in kernel
exceptions and vice-versa.**


Getting started
---------------

The [tutorial for local
notebooks](https://github.com/hashiprobr/jupyter-jchannel/blob/main/examples/local-kernel.ipynb)
should be enough to introduce the basic usage.

Remote notebooks require setting up a proxy. Tutorials in Binder and Colab are
available below.
