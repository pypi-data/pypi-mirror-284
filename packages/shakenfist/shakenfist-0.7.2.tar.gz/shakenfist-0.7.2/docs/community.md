# Welcome to the Shaken Fist community

First off, Shaken Fist is an open source project covered by the Apache2 license. The community is relatively small at this point and we're still working out what works for us. For now, we communicate through the following mechanisms:

* GitHub issues and pull requests in the various repositories.
* A slack workspace at https://shakenfist.slack.com -- unfortunately you need to be invited to that workspace, but we're happy to do that. If you're interested, please email mikal@stillhq.com.

# Supporters

We try to track supporters here. Our apologies if we've missed someone, let us know and we'll fix it.

* [Michael Still](https://www.madebymikal.com) and Andrew McCallum have contributed significant personal time to the project.
* [Aptira](https://www.aptira.com) has donated developer time, as well as provided invaluable feedback from the largest real world deployments that we've had so far.
* [FifthDomain](https://www.fifthdomain.com.au) has also donated developer time.
