    emails based on their state or purpose.

    Attributes
    ----------
    INBOX : str
        The primary mailbox where incoming emails are delivered.

    Notes
    -----
    Using a standardized set of mailboxes ensures consistency in how emails are
    categorized and accessed across different email clients and services. It also
    simplifies the development of email handling features by providing a clear structure
    for organizing emails.

    Purpose:
    This enumeration defines different status items that can be associated with a

    a mailbox. They help email clients to display the current state of a mailbox, such
    as the number of unread messages, and assist in the efficient handling of email
    operations, such as fetching new messages or maintaining the integrity of unique
    identifiers.
