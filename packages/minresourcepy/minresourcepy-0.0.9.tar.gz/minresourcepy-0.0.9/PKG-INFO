# MinResourcepy

 Hi there,

 This Python library is a continual work in progress, aimed at expanding with tools to assist and validate block models, 
 along with tackling complex operations in resource geology. It serves as a compilation and standardization of scripts developed (with the 
 assistance of my colleagues) during my journey as a Resource Geo on Earth Planet!
  
 
It's open and collaborative, so your contributions to the code are more than welcome.

 ## Package Inventory
 1) **tongrade** - Generates values for a TonXGrade chart (both X and Y axis) with the option to choose proportion over tonnage as the output.
 2) **xyzrotate** - Allows rotation and unrotation of block models or points, akin to the CDTRAN function in Datamine.
 3) **pplot** -  Generates dynamic probability plots to aid in outlier definition.
 4) **describew** - Yields output similar to .describe(), considering a weight variable.
 5) **dist_reschart** - Generates a distance histogram for Mineral Resource classification, color-coding bars by category (measured, indicated, inferred). The X-axis denotes the sample distance to blocks (minimum or average depending on your objective).
 6) **topcutstat** - It assists the top-cut definition providing the statistics of a variable (including the metal loss and number of capped samples), given a list of capping values.

## Next Updates
Future plans include creating package examples as a user guide and continually adding new tools.
