HTML report
===========

Summary and configuration
-------------------------

The HTML report begins with a summary of the test setup. Starting with the test
status, then summarizing the test environment/configuration. The failed status
appears when at least a test status of a frame size is set to failed
(more details are provided in the next sub-section).

Results Summary
---------------

This part presents a concise overview of the aggregate findings from tests
conducted on all the frames sizes:

#. Histogram of the maximum Ethernet layer 2 tested throughput Vs expected
   maximum throughput for each frame size. Please note that, as mentioned
   before, this speed is calculated for frames without including the FCS.
#. Histogram of number trials and test duration (in seconds)
   for each frame size.
#. Summary table of all tests' results. This summary table include the frame
   size without FCS, Source & Destination, Duration of the test, tolerated
   frame loss (in %), the expected/real maximum Ethernet layer 2 throughput,
   number of runtime errors, and the status of this test.
   A test is considered as failed if:

   * A runtime error occurs and interrupts the execution (for example,
     configuration file error, ByteBlower server went down, detecting
     duplicate frames which causes that trial to be rerun more time than
     allowed, ...). In case an error appears but the trial rerun and the
     rest of the test end successfully, the error count is increased
     (details of the error in the error log part), but the status of
     the test is decided based on the throughput findings only.
   * At least one frame results is less than expected (the maximum Ethernet
     layer 2 tested throughput is less than expected)

   Else, the test has finished successfully. You can click on the Status icon
   to be redirected to detailed results for the frame size of your choice.

Frame results (HTML)
--------------------

The third part of the report details the results for each frame size, with a
graph depicting how tested bitrate and frame loss vary over test trials,
in addition to a table containing the frame configuration, maximum
Ethernet layer 2 tested throughput and test duration.

Error logs (HTML)
-----------------

This part could be present to highlight logs of the runtime error that may
occur, which are ordered in a table by frame size and timestamp. These logs
precise the error type and it's message that provides details about the cause
of the error.

JSON result file
================

Ths JSON file consists of 3 main parts in addition to the *"status"* field,
which indicates if the execution completed correctly.

Configuration
-------------
This part contain the ByteBlower server host name and both used endpoints for
the test (as detailed in :doc:`config`)

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "configuration": {
           "server": "byteblower-integration-3100-1.lab.byteblower.excentis.com.",
           "source": {
               "name": "Source",
               "interface": "trunk-1-3",
               "ipv4": "172.16.0.50",
               "gateway": "172.16.0.1",
               "netmask": "255.252.0.0"
           },
           "destination": {
               "name": "Destination",
               "interface": "trunk-1-13",
               "ipv4": "dhcp",
               "nat": true
           }
       }
   }

Frame results (JSON)
--------------------

In here, you can find a lit of detailed frame results grouped by frame size.
For each frame size, it provides at first the used frame configuration. Then,
we have all trial result, where we find, for each trial:

* bitrate: The tested bitrate in bits/s
* passed: the status of the test
  (whether the frame_loss <= tolerated_frame_loss)
* tx_packets: Count of transmitted packets
* rx_packets: Count of received packets
* timestamp: Marks when the trial ended (in ISO 8601 format)
* duration: Duration of the test in seconds

Finally, you can find the real_bitrate, which is the last tested bitrate before
reaching the required accuracy, the maximum number of iterations allowed
per frame size, or the maximum number of retries allowed on runtime errors.

Error logs (JSON)
-----------------

In the event of runtime errors, error logs are saved in here to assist find the
causes, and eventually try to avoid them in the future. Errors logs are also
gathered by frame size and ordered by timestamp.

Each item contains:

* Exception type
* Error message giving more details about what went wrong
* Timestamp of when the error happened
