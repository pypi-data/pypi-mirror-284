system,"You are participating in an online survey and/or experiment. Each prompt contains a summary of the survey/experiment including your answers so far, scraped text data from a webpage continuing the survey/experiment, and detailed tasks for you on how to analyze this text data. The materials might contain information on how participants are being compensated or paid for their participation. If this is the case, please act as if this compensation also applies to you and make sure to include this information in the summary. Answers must be given as JSON code ONLY. No text outside of the JSON answer is allowed at any time. In each prompt, I will provide you with detailed information on the respective format."
start,"Hi there! In this conversation. I want you to participate in an online survey and/or experiment, potentially involving other human or artificial participants. I will provide you with a series of web page body text excerpts that will sequentially guide you through the experiment/survey. The texts will contain instructions on how the experiment/survey will be conducted. These instructions will be followed by additional pages that might contain additional instructions, comprehension checks, repeated information from prior pages and, most importantly, present you with questions and/or tasks which I want you to answer. All answers must be given as JSON code ONLY and I will provide you with detailed information on the respective format. As all texts are scraped from the body parts of web pages, they might contain also additional information or text bits that do not really belong to the experiment. Do you understand your task? Please answer by setting the value of 'understood' to 'yes' or 'no', meaning that {""understood"": ""yes""} indicates that you understand. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. If you are confused, respond with {""error"": ""I am confused""}."
analyze_page_no_q_full_hist,"Perfect. You have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:\n\n{body}\n\nI need you to summarize the content of the page and indicate what you learn from it about the survey/experiment that you are participating in. Provide the summary as a string variable 'summary' in a JSON string.Please note that, while you can use JSON to structure the summary content, the variable itself must be provided as a string." 
analyze_page_q_full_hist,"Perfect. You have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:\n\n{body}\n\nI need you to do two things. First, this page contains {nr_q} question(s) and I need you to answer all questions in the variable 'questions'. Second, I need you to summarize the content of the page including all questions and your answer. Provide the summary as the variable 'summary'. More on this below. So, your JSON answer will contain the variables 'questions', and 'summary'. I need you to answer all questions. The following JSON string contains the questions: '{questions_json}'. Each question is characterized by an ID ('question_id'), question type ('question_type'),  and a label ('question_label'). Additionally, if the question type requires it, you will also be provided with answer choices. If there are answer choices provided, first answer with the full answer choice text and do not just answer with a number indicating the answer choice. Second please strictly adhere to the given answer choices, please do not select something outside of the given answer choices. If there are no answer choices provided, it means you can answer the question freely. If the question type is 'number', please only provide an integer number. This means that for each identified question, you must provide three variables: 'id' gives the question ID, 'reason' contains your reasoning or thought that leads you to a response or answer and finally, 'answer' which contains your response. The above implies that each question must be answered with a dict of these three variables and, 'questions' becomes a list of dicts if there is more than one question. Taken together, a correct answer to a text with two questions would have the form {{""questions"": [{{""id"": ""ID of first question"", ""reason"": ""Your reasoning"", ""answer"": ""Your answer""}}, {{""id"": ""ID of second question"", ""reason"": ""Your reasoning"", ""answer"": ""Your answer""}}], ""summary"": ""Your summary""}}.Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON.
