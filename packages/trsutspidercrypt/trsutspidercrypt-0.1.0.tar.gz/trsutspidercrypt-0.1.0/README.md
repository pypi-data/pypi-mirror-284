Here's a more complete README for your `trustspidercrypt` library:

```markdown
# Spidercryptencrypt

trustspidecrypt is an encryption library that utilizes AES in CBC mode for secure data encryption and decryption.

## Installation

You can install trustspidercrypt via pip:

```bash
pip install trustspidercrypt
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use trustspidercrypt:

```python
from trustspidercrypt import Trustspidercrypt

# Example key (must be 32 bytes for AES-256)
key = b'my_32_byte_secret_key!'  
cipher = Spidercryptencrypt(key)

# Encrypting data
plaintext = b'Hello, world!'
encrypted = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)
print("Encrypted:", encrypted)

# Decrypting data
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(encrypted)
print("Decrypted:", decrypted.decode())  # Outputs: Hello, world!
```
