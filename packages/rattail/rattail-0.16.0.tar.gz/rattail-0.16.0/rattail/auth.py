        You may of course define a custom handler and then could
        authenticate against anything you like, e.g. the POS system or
        LDAP etc.  The only trick is that this must return a Rattail
        user, not some other kind.  So you may have to devisde a way
        to auto-create the Rattail user as needed, when authentication
        for the external system succeeds.

        Generally speaking the credentials passed in will have come
        directly from a user login attempt in the web app etc.  Again

        is *not* yet taken.

        It returns the first "available" (hence unique) username which
        is found.  Note that it is considered unique and therefore
        available *at the time*; however this method does not
