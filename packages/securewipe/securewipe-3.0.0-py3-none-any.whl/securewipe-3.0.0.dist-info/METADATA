# securewipe 3.0.0

- `securewipe` is a Python package for securely wiping files or folders by overwriting them with random data. It also provides a command-line interface (CLI) for easy usage.
- You can rely on Securewipe to overwrite the data using various patterns, ensuring it is virtually impossible to recover.

## Benefits

- **Security:** Ensures sensitive files or directories are securely wiped by overwriting them with random data, making recovery impossible.
- **Ease of Use:** Provides a straightforward CLI interface and Python API for integrating secure file wiping into applications and scripts.
- **Customization:** Allows customization through Python scripts for specific file or directory wiping requirements.
  
## Installation

You can install `securewipe` via pip:

```bash
pip install securewipe
```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

#### Overwrite a specific file

To overwrite a specific file with random data:

```bash
securewipe --self-destruct /path/to/file.txt
```

#### Overwrite all files in a directory

To overwrite all files within a directory with random data:

```bash
securewipe --self-destruct /path/to/folder/
```

### Python Code Examples

#### Self-destruct current script

```python
from securewipe import replace_random

try:
    replace_random(__file__)
    print("Self-destructed successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

#### Overwrite a specific file

```python
from securewipe import replace_random

file_path = '/path/to/file.txt'

try:
    replace_random(file_path)
    print(f"Successfully overwritten: {file_path}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

#### Overwrite all files in a directory

```python
import os
from securewipe import replace_random

folder_path = '/path/to/folder/'

try:
    for file_name in os.listdir(folder_path):
        file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file_name)
        if os.path.isfile(file_path):
            replace_random(file_path)
            print(f"Successfully overwritten: {file_path}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
