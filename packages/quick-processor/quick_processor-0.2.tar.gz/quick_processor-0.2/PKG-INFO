## quick_processor

### Overview
`quick_processor` is a Python-based text preprocessing tool designed to simplify and standardize text cleaning tasks for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. It leverages a variety of libraries, including NLTK, BeautifulSoup, and contractions, to provide a comprehensive suite of text cleaning functions.

### Features
- **Lowercase Conversion**: Converts all characters in a sentence to lowercase.
- **Email Removal**: Removes email addresses from the text.
- **Diacritic Removal**: Strips diacritics from characters.
- **HTML Cleaning**: Removes HTML tags from the text.
- **Repeated Character Replacement**: Replaces repeated punctuation marks with a single occurrence.
- **Emoji Translation**: Translates emojis into their textual representation.
- **Contraction Expansion**: Expands common contractions (e.g., "can't" to "cannot").
- **URL Removal**: Strips URLs from the text.
- **Possessive Removal**: Removes possessive forms from words.
- **Extra Space Removal**: Eliminates extra spaces.
- **Spelling Correction**: Corrects spelling errors.
- **Tokenization**: Splits text into tokens.
- **Stopword Removal**: Removes common stopwords.
- **Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their base or root form.
- **Emoticon Removal**: Removes emoticons from the text.
- **Non-Alphabetic Character Removal**: Strips non-alphabetic characters from the text.

### Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install nltk contractions beautifulsoup4 emoji spellchecker
```

### Usage
Here's an example of how to use `quick_processor` for text preprocessing:

```python
from preprocessor import Preprocessor

# Initialize the preprocessor
preprocessor = Preprocessor()

# Sample sentence
sentence = "This is a sample sentence with an email@example.com and a link http://example.com ðŸ˜Š"

# Clean the sentence using default steps
cleaned_sentence = preprocessor.clean(sentence)

print(cleaned_sentence)
```

### Unit Tests
The project includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the functionality of each preprocessing step. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
python preprocessor.py
```

### File Structure
- **preprocessor.py**: Contains the `Preprocessor` class and the `test` function for running unit tests.
- **README.md**: Project documentation (this file).
