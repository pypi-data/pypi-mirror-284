        =======
        
        This is a quick collection of little (f)MRI utils functions collected together because I found myself using them quite often, packaged in pip to be easy to adopt.
        I have no idea nor strict plan to where this project should/could/would go.
        If you find yourself using this project (why?) let me know - so I can decide how to properly make it citable. 
        
        **The project is currently (and in perpetuum) under development**.
        Any suggestion/bug report is welcome! Feel free to open an issue.
