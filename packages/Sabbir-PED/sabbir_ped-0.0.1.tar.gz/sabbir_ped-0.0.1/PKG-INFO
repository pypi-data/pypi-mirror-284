Summary: A Python program to encode and decode strings using custom character mappings.
Author: Mohammad Sabbir Hosen
Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

This Python program allows you to:

1. Encode a given text using a custom character mapping.

2. Decode the encoded text back to its original form using a reverse mapping dictionary.

The encoding function replaces each character in the input string with its corresponding mapped value, while the decoding function reverses this process, ensuring accurate retrieval of the original text.
