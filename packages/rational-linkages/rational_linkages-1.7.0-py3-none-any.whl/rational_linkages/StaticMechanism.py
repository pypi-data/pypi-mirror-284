class StaticMechanism(RationalMechanism):
    """
    A class to represent a non-rational mechanism with a fixed number of joints

    This class is highly specialized and not intended for general use of Rational
    Linkages package. It can be used e.g. for obtaining the design (DH parameters, etc.)
    of a mechanism that has no rational parametrization.
    The joints  are assembled in a fixed loop-closure configuration. They are defined
    by a list of screw axes that are used to define the motion of the mechanism.

    :param list[NormalizedLine] screw_axes: A list of screw axes that define the
        kinematic structure of the mechanism.

    :ivar list[NormalizedLine] screws: A list of screw axes that define the kinematic
        structure of the mechanism.
    :ivar int num_joints: The number of joints in the mechanism.

    :example:

    .. testcode::

        # Define a 4-bar mechanism from points
