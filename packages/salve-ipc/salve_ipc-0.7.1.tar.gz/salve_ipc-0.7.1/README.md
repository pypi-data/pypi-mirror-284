<h1 align="center">Salve v0.7.1</h1>

# Installation

In the Command Line, paste the following: `pip install salve_ipc`

## Description

Salve is an IPC library that can be used by code editors to easily get autocompletions, replacements, editorconfig suggestions, definitions, and syntax highlighting.

> **Notes:**
>  - The first time that the system is loaded or a new server needs to be started it will take a fair bit longer.
>  - Any usage of IPC needs to eventually be called from an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to prevent a multiproccesing error.
>  - Due to the way Windows handles chars the hidden character highlighter may not work properly. See [#57](https://github.com/Moosems/salve/pull/57). If anyone knows how to fix this, I would greatly appreciate you opening a PR :)

## Documentation

### `COMMANDS`

The `COMMANDS` list contains all valid commands to request server output from. If multiple requests of different commands are made they will be kept and held seperately and can be retrieved seperately. Current commands are as follows:

- "autocomplete"
- "replacements"
- "highlight"
- "editorconfig"
- "definition"

These can be imported as string constants (`AUTOCOMPLETE`, `REPLACEMENTS`, `HIGHLIGHT`, `EDITORCONFIG`, `DEFINITION`) for usage in calling requests and requesting output from the server while getting "spelling checks" from your code editor so to speak (E.G. not very hard to misspell "autocomplete" as "autocopmlete").

### `Token` type alias

The `Token` type alias helps your type checker when you work with `Token`'s from salve.

### `generic_tokens`

The `generic_tokens` list is a list of strings that define all of the generic token types returned by the server which can be mapped to colors for syntax highlighting.

### `hidden_chars`

The `hidden_chars` (`dict[str, str]`) dictionary holds a bunch of hidden (zero width) characters as keys and then names for them as values. `Token`'s of type "Hidden_Char" give the index to hidden characters and allow the user to display hidden characters to them that they may not see. These characters appear in code posted on forums or blogs by those hoping to prevent others from simply copy-pasting their code along with many other places.

### `Response` TypedDict class

The `Response` TypedDict classs allows for type checking when handling output from salve_ipc.

### `is_unicode_letter(char: str) -> bool`

The `is_unicode_letter()` function returns a boolean if a given word is a unicode letter (includes "\_" as special case) which can be useful when trying to find the current word being typed to hand to the IPC for autocompletion.

### Basic Usage:

```python
from time import sleep

from salve_ipc import IPC, Response, HIGHLIGHT


def main():
    context = IPC()

    context.update_file(
        "test",
        open(__file__, "r+").read() * 20,
    )

    context.request(
        HIGHLIGHT, file="test", language="python", text_range=(1, 30)
    )

    sleep(1)
    output: Response | None = context.get_response(HIGHLIGHT)
    print(output["result"])  # type: ignore
    context.kill_IPC()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Contributing

To contribute, fork the repository, make your changes, and then make a pull request. If you want to add a feature, please open an issue first so it can be discussed. Note that whenever and wherever possible you should try to use stdlib modules rather than external ones.

## Required Python Version: 3.11+

Salve IPC will use the three most recent versions (full releases) going forward and will drop any older versions as new ones come out. This is because I hope to keep this package up to date with modern python versions as they come out instead of being forced to maintain decade old python versions.
Currently 3.11 is the minimum (instead of 3.10) as Salve IPC was developed under 3.12 and there are many features that Salve IPC relies on from this version I want. However, after 3.14 is released, the minimum version will be 3.12 (as would be expected from the plan) and will change accordingly in the future as is described in the plan above.
