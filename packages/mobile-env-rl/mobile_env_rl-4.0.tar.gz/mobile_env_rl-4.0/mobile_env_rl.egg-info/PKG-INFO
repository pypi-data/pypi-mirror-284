              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

## NEWS!!

* (2024-07-14 v4.0)
  * Added new action and observation type of ADB
  * Enabled input of common UTF-8 strings for `TEXT` action
  * Enabled fuzzy match method for screen text events. Enabled triggering
    threshold for fuzzy match modes.
  * Migrated from `dm_env` to `android_env.interfaces` to distinguish
    successful, failed, and truncated episode ends. Updated episode end events
    to control its triggering in the task definition file more conviniently.
  * Added `cache_until` field for event slots to correctly trigger an `AND`
    node whose sub-events are expected to be triggered simultaneously.  Now an
    activatated event can be cached temporarily until another triggered event
    clears it.
  * Added `null_listener` for target-less event nodes.
  * Applied image compression in `RemoteSimulator`.
  * Migrated from `gym` to `gymnasium`.
  * Updates to `VhIoWrapper` and `TapActionWrapper`
  * Minor updates to annotation tool.

See our [Change Log](Changelog) for details. The documents will be revised
soon. A new tutorial w.r.t. episode event management is on plan.

* (2024-04-30 v3.6)
  * Updated function to load a remote simulator to enable providing the remote
    resources with a different path with the path of the local task definition
    file.
  * Updated task template toolkit, added new slot modifiers and sytaxes for
    task config file.
  * Fixed known bugs.

* (2023-12-18 v3.5)
  * Owing to the long time delay of VH check and screenshot check, we updated
    the mechanism of managing the check time. By this way, the requirement of
    sufficient check for the episode events and the resulted long delay can be
    balanced.
  * Added multiple rating methods to `ResponseEvent`: regex matching, fuzzy
    matching, and vector encoding matching.
  * Improved `VhIoWrapper` and `TapActionWrapper`. Added support to `SCROLL`
    and `TYPE` to `TapActionWrapper`.
  * Optimized `RemoteSimulator`. In order to reduce the delay of network
    transfering, enabled action batch to send and execute a group of actions
    and enabled resizing the image before and after transferring to shrink the
    transferred data.
  * Merged annotation tool to the main branch. The original annotation-tool
    branch is deprecated.
  * Added support to `ResponseEvent` to annotation tool.
  * Supplemented several commandline options to annotation-tool.

For more details, please see our [Change Log](Changelog) and Documents.

* (2023-10-31 v3.0) Migrated VH node specification from the original VH path to
  Mobile-Env-customized CSS selector (me-selector) and added repeatability
  control to EventSlots. Repeatability control for EventSlots may be useful to
  prevent repetitive triggering of an `OR`-type virtual event combining
  multiple types of event sources.

Please see our [Change Log](Changelog) and
[Document](docs/task-definition-en.md).

* (2023-09-21 v2.1) Added *REMOTE SIMULATOR* to solve the problem that
  hardware-based acceleration for virtualization is not enabled on many GPU
  clusters

Please see our [Change Log](Changelog) and [Document](docs/env-usage-en.md).

* (2023-06-30 v2.0) New type of event "response to human user" (RHU,
  `ResponseEvent`). Now enables the agent to generate response to human user
  and parses episode signales from it. This will enable interaction tasks like
  question-answering, retrieval, *etc*.

Please see our [Change Log](Changelog), [Usage Document](docs/env-usage-en.md),
and [Task Definition Document](docs/task-definition-en.md).

# Mobile-Env: Building Qualified Evaluation Benchmarks for GUI Interaction

Mobile-Env is a interaction platform for building evaluation benchmarks for GUI
interaction and evaluating and training GUI agents.  Our paper is available at
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08144).

Mobile-Env is developed based on
[AndroidEnv](https://github.com/deepmind/android_env). The agent can take the
screenshot and the view hierarchy (disabled defaultly for the long latency) as
the observation and take a touch or type a token as the action to interact with
the Android apps. Several episode signals like step instructions, rewards, or
the episode end will be informed during interaction at some crucial steps. A
so-called crucial step may be opening a target page, srolling to a correct
area, *etc*. and is depending on the specific [task
definition](docs/task-definition-en.md).

The proposed WikiHow task set is available at the [Hugging Face
Platform](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zdy023/WikiHow-taskset).

* [Documents in Chinese (中文文档)](README-zh.md)

## Index

* [Evaluating and Training Agents on Mobile-Env](docs/env-usage-en.md)
* [Extending a New Environment (App) or a New Task Based on
  Mobile-Env](docs/task-definition-en.md)
* [Certificate Pinning Problem & Solutions](docs/dynamic-app-en.md)
* [Miscellaneous Auxiliary Tools](docs/other-tools-en.md)

## Platform Features

Mobile-Env is a flexible, adaptable, and easily-extendable platform for InfoUI
interaction with the following features:

* Both screenshot and view hierarchy are provided as the observation. The touch
  and token typing are provided as the action. Wrappers are also supported to
  customize the observation and action spaces. Thus, both visual-based and
  text-based agents, both agents with continuous action space and discrete
  action space, can be evaluated on Mobile-Env.
* New tasks can be easily extended through task definition files.
* Multiple sources are enabled to parse the task events from the operating
  system: screen text, screen icon, view hierarchy, and the system log, which
  makes Mobile-Env capable of adapting to most real-world apps without
  dedicated development. (Screen text and screen icon will be enabled with an
  external OCR tool and icon recognition tool. Currently, a wrapper of
  [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) is integrated in the platform
  and can be enabled directly. An intergrated icon model will be embedded soon
  as well.)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install from PyPI:

```sh
pip insall mobile-env-rl
```

or clone the repository and build locally.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/X-LANCE/Mobile-Env
cd Mobile-Env
pip install .
```

Several [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/zdy023/mobile-env-rl) with
well-configured Android AVD are also available.

### Load and Run Mobile-Env for Evaluation or Training

Before loading the Mobile-Env environment, you will need to set up an [Android
Emulator](https://developer.android.com/about) device. Then you can load the
environment with some existing task definitions and start your experiments. A
detailed guidance is provided in [Evaluating and Traning Agents on
Mobile-Env](docs/env-usage-en.md). Several examples with a random agent or a
human agent is also provided under `examples`.

### Extend a New Environment or a New Task

To extend a new environment for Mobile-Env, the environment designer needs to
prepare the app package and ensure that the package manages to launch and run
on some versions of Android Emulator. If the app requires varying online data,
the necessary data should be crawled and dumped and then be replayed for a
consistent evaluation. In such case, the designer is supposed to validate the
certain effectiveness of [certificate unpinning plan](docs/dynamic-app-en.md)
for the package.  As regards to extend new tasks, task definition files are
just required. Detailed instructions can be found in [Extending a New
Environment (App) or a New Task Based on
Mobile-Env](docs/task-definition-en.md).

Several demo task definitions are provided under `demos`. Three of them are
migrated from  AndroidEnv:

* `classic_2048.m.textproto` - [Classic 2048
  game](https://github.com/google-deepmind/android_env/blob/main/docs/example_tasks.md#classic-2048).
* `accessibility_forwarder_clock_set_timer.m.textproto` - A simple task
  requiring the agent to [reset a running
  timer](https://github.com/google-deepmind/android_env/blob/main/docs/example_tasks.md#accessibility-forwarder).
* `systemui_egg_land_default.m.textproto` - [Flappy
  Droid](https://github.com/google-deepmind/android_env/blob/main/docs/example_tasks.md#flappydroid).
  An open-sourced implementation of classic game, Flappy Bird.

Another one, `openmoneybox.add_billings.textproto` is defined upon an
open-sourced billing app,
[OpenMoneyBox](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.igisw.openmoneybox/).
Details are referred to in the task definition files.

### Miscellaneous Auxiliary Tools

We also developed an annotation tool for the human demonstrations, and a suite
of template tool to auto-generate task definitions according to templates and
to combine multiple task definitions to form a multi-step task. The details are
referred to in [Miscellaneous Auxiliary Tools](docs/other-tools-en.md).
