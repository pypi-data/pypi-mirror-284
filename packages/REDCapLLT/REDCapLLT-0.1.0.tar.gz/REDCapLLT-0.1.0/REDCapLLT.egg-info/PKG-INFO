# REDCap Language Library Translator

## Overview

The REDCap Language Library Translator is a Python script designed to translate the "default" values in a REDCap JSON file  into a user-defined language using the Google Translate API. The script handles large text translations by breaking them into manageable chunks and also manages translation errors by logging them into a separate file.

## Features

- **Language Support:** Translates "default" values into a wide range of languages.
- **Chunk Processing:** Handles large texts by breaking them into smaller chunks.
- **Error Handling:** Logs any translation errors into a separate file.
- **JSON Key Updates:** Updates the `display` and `key` fields in the JSON file to reflect the new language.

## How It Works

1. **User Input:**
   - The script prompts the user for the full path to the JSON file.
   - The user specifies the target language for translation.

2. **Extract Default Values:**
   - The script extracts all "default" and "translation" values from the JSON file.

3. **Create Subfolder:**
   - A subfolder is created based on the version of the JSON file and the target language.

4. **Save Extracted Data:**
   - The extracted data is saved into a new JSON file within the subfolder.

5. **Translate Values:**
   - The script translates the "default" values in the new JSON file.
   - If any translation errors occur, the corresponding key-value pairs are logged into a separate "errors" file.

6. **Update Original JSON:**
   - The script updates the original JSON file with the new translated values.
   - The `display` and `key` fields are updated to reflect the new language.

7. **Cleanup:**
   - The temporary translation file is deleted.

## Installation

To use this script, you need to have Python and the `googletrans` package installed. You can install the package using the following command:

```sh
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
```

## Usage
1. Save the script to a file named REDCap_Language_Library_Translator.py.
2. Run the script using Python:

```sh
python REDCap_Language_Library_Translator.py
```
3. Follow the prompts to enter the full path to your JSON file and the desired language for translation.

## Error Handling
If any errors occur during the translation process, the script logs the corresponding key-value pairs into a separate file named {language}_errors.json within the subfolder. This allows users to review and address translation issues separately.
