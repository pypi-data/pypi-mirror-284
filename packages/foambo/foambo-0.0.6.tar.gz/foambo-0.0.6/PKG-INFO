# Multi Objective Optimization on OpenFOAM cases

<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7997394"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/611991004.svg"></a>

> If you're using this piece of software, please care enough to [cite it](https://zenodo.org/record/7997394) in your publications

Relying on [ax-platform](https://ax.dev) to experiment around 0-code parameter variation and multi-objective optimization
of OpenFOAM cases.

## Objectives and features
- Parameter values are fetched through a YAML/JSON configuration file. Absolutely no code should be needed, add parameters
  to the YAML file and they should be picked up automatically
- The no-code thing is taken to the extreme, through a YAML config file, you can (need-to):
  - Specify the template case
  - Specify how the case is ran
  - Specify how/where parameters are substituted
  - Specify how your metrics are computed

## How do I try this out?

Some [examples](examples), which range from simple and moderate levels of complexity, are provided
as reference.

Strictly speaking, you don't need an OpenFOAM installation unless you are running a CFD case. You
can always use your own code to evaluate the trials;  but parameters must be passed through an
OpenFOAM-like dictionary (See [single-objective opt. example](examples/local/single-objective)
for inspiration.
