# Russound RIO Async Python Package

This module implements a Python client for the Russound I/O (RIO) protocol used to control Russound audio controllers. RIO supports a superset of the RNET feature set, allows for push notifications of system changes and supports TCP/IP and RS232 communication.

## Acknowledgements
This is the continuation of the `russound_rio` package. This wouldn't be possible without the excellent work from [@wickerwaka](https://github.com/wickerwaka) and [@chphilli](https://github.com/chphilli).
