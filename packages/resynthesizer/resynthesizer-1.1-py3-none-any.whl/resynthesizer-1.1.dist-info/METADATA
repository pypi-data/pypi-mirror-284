Python library which wraps 61315's pure C implementation of resynthesizer (open-source Content-Aware Fill equivalent)

Usage:
```python
from resynthesizer import resynthesize
from PIL import Image

source = Image.open('source.jpg')
# mask must have black background, white foreground
mask = Image.open('mask.png')
result = resynthesize(source, mask)
result.save('result.jpg')

```
