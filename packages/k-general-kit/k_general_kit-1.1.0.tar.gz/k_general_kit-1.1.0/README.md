# K-General-Kit 🛠️

This project aims to provide a rich set of useful general functions frequently needed and frequent objects.

## Features 💡

* It contains a general library, for general functions on containiers, string, a bit of mathematics
* We also find a search_sort library, with powerful search and sort algorithms going from the sequential search to the exponential search and from the select sort to the merge sort.
* We also have the gen_obj library for frequents objects like math constants with the ability to ameliorate their precisions
* We also have eval_sequence, which gives powerful functions to evaluate recursive functions, bypassing the recursivity.
* Thera are also an interesting set of datas going from prime numbers collections to txt dictionnaries (for words counting functions).

## Examples of use 📝

```python
from k_general_kit.gen_func import all

print(nel(45)) # prints "quarante cinq"

print(words_sentence("Hello, everyone!", 'en')) # prints "['Hello', 'everyone']"


```

For more tests, use in the project directory the command python -m tests.eval_func or the built-in command in .vscode
