# Python interface to SWF
Typed Python interface to AWS Simple Workflow service

* Type annotations
* Explicit exceptions
* Execution state construction
* Consistent method/attribute/parameter names (see below)
* Consistent model struture
* Automatic flattening of paged-list responses
  * next-page calls are run concurrently and on-demand
* Better execution filtering

The most interesting part is state construction: given an execution history, this
library can build a full state of the execution and all of its tasks with all details;
see [`swf_typed.build_state`](
  https://python-swf-typed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/swf_typed._state.html#swf_typed.build_state
). The rest of the API simply wraps and closely matches AWS's SWF API.

## Installation
```shell
pip install swf-typed
```

## Usage
See [the full documentation](https://python-swf-typed.readthedocs.io/).

### Example
```python
import swf_typed

execution = swf_typed.ExecutionId(id="spam", run_id="abcd1234")
execution_details = swf_typed.describe_execution(execution, domain="eggs")
print(execution_details.configuration)

events = swf_typed.get_execution_history(execution, domain="eggs")
state = swf_typed.build_state(events)
for task in state.tasks:
    print(task.status)
```

### Terminology
This library uses a slight terminology change from SWF SDKs/APIs:
* Workflow type -> workflow
* Workflow execution -> execution
* Workflow execution `workflowId` -> execution ID
* Activity type -> activity
* Activity task -> task
* Activity worker -> worker
* Activity task `activityId` -> task ID
