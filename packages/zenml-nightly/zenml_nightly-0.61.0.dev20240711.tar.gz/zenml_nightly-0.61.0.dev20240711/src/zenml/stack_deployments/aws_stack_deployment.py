You will be redirected to the AWS console in your browser where you'll be asked
to log into your AWS account and create a CloudFormation ZenML stack. The stack
parameters will be pre-filled with the necessary information to connect ZenML to
your AWS account, so you should only need to review and confirm the stack.

After the CloudFormation stack is deployed, you can return to the CLI to view
details about the associated ZenML stack automatically registered with ZenML.

**NOTE**: The CloudFormation stack will create the following new resources in
your AWS account. Please ensure you have the necessary permissions and are aware
of any potential costs:

- An S3 bucket registered as a [ZenML artifact store](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/artifact-stores/s3).
- An ECR repository registered as a [ZenML container registry](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/container-registries/aws).
- Sagemaker registered as a [ZenML orchestrator](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/orchestrators/sagemaker).
- An IAM user and IAM role with the minimum necessary permissions to access the
above resources.
- An AWS access key used to give access to ZenML to connect to the above
resources through a [ZenML service connector](https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/auth-management/aws-service-connector).

The CloudFormation stack will automatically create an AWS secret key and
will share it with ZenML to give it permission to access the resources created
by the stack. You can revoke these permissions at any time by deleting the
CloudFormation stack.
