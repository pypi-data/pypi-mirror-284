# CNTools

## System requirements
The software denpendencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`. The software is independent of operating systems except that it needs Rosetta translation to work in macOS with Apple silicon.

## Installation guide
As we need a conda package pydot=1.4.2 (not a pip one), the package should be installed by
```
conda create -n cntools python=3.8 pydot=1.4.2
conda activate cntools
python -m pip install cntools
```
In macOS with Apple silicon, the package should be installed in a x86-64 conda environment by
```
CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 conda create -n cntools python=3.8 pydot=1.4.2
conda activate cntools
python -m pip install cntools
``` 

## Instructions for use

### Idenfity and smooth cellular neighborhoods
See `tests/test_crc.ipynb` for CRC dataset, `tests/test_t2d.ipynb` for T2D dataset, and `tests/test_hlt.ipynb` for HLT dataset. For example, to run CNE on the CRC dataset, just do
```
from cntools.datasets import load_ct_order, prep_crc, Dataset
from cntools.identification import CNE
from cntools.smoothing import NaiveSmooth

# load dataset
df = prep_crc(pd.read_csv('data/CRC/CRC_clusters_neighborhoods_markers.csv'))
ct_order = load_ct_order('data/CRC/ct_order.json')
ds = Dataset(df, ct_order)

# identify
identifier = CNE(n_cns=9, perp=15, lam=0.25)
cns = identifier.fit(ds) # output CN

# smooth
smoother = NaiveSmooth(ds=ds, n_cns=identifier.n_cns, feats=identifier.feats, s=3)
cns_smoothed_naive = smoother.fit(cns) # output CN after smoothing
```

### Analyze cellular neighborhoods
See jupyter notebooks in the `tests/analysis` folder.

## Demo
Run `tests/test_crc.ipynb`, `tests/test_t2d.ipynb`, and `tests/test_hlt.ipynb` for CN identification and smoothing. Run jupyter notebooks in the `tests/analysis/` folder for CN analyses. Expected CN outputs are in the `tests/cn/*/CNE/` folder. Expected analysis outputs are in the `tests/analysis_res/*/CNE/` folder.
