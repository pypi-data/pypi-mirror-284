    "General Help": "How to BindCompare! (Scroll through to see all components of this app).\n\nEnter BindCompareInputs:\nEnter in all of the file inputs and variables to run BindCompare. Details regarding these parameters can be found in the linked Help Manual.\n\nRun BindCompare:\nOnce you have entered all inputs, you can click the run button. The interface will freeze while it runs and status updates will be printed in the terminal from which the app was launched.\n\nVisualizing and Interperting:\nUse the visualize tab to look at different output plots. You can use the help dropdown to find mini-explanations of each plot.",
    "BarDist": "Visualizes the distribution of overlap types. The color scheme matches that of the reference plots.",
    "BarSum": "Col 1: Shows the number of binding peaks in the experimental file. Col 2: Unique overlaps within the 402 (as multiple can occur in the same place). Col 4: Unique reference sites that are overlapped.",
    "RefFreq": "Plots the average binding profile of the reference peak in black. At each position in the scoped domain, a colored line indicates the number of overlaps of that type that occur at a given position. For example, if the purple line is at 16 at x=500, then there were 500 complete overlaps at this position.",
    "Pie": "Provides a similar visualization of BarDist in a PieChart format.",
    "ChromFreq": "Provides the same visualization as RefFreq but creates separate plots for each chromosome.",
