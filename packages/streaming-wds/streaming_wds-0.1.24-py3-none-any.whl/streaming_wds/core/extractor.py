        output_queue (Queue): Queue for outputting extracted samples.
        stop_event (threading.Event): Event to signal stopping of the extraction process.
        buffer_size (int): Maximum buffer size for memory management.
        cache (LocalShardLRUCache): Local cache for storing and retrieving shards.
        input_finish_event (threading.Event): Event to signal completion of input.
