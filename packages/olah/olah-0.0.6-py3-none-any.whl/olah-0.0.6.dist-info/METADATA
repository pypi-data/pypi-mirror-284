# olah
Olah is self-hosted lightweight huggingface mirror service. `Olah` means `hello` in Hilichurlian.

Other languages: [中文](README_zh.md)

## Advantages of Olah
Olah has the capability to cache files in chunks while users download them. Upon subsequent downloads, the files can be directly retrieved from the cache, greatly enhancing download speeds and saving bandwidth.
Additionally, Olah offers a range of cache control policies. Administrators can configure which repositories are accessible and which ones can be cached through a configuration file.

## Features
* Huggingface Data Cache
* Models mirror
* Datasets mirror
* Spaces mirror

## Install

### Method 1: With pip

```bash
pip install olah
```

or:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/vtuber-plan/olah.git 
```

### Method 2: From source

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vtuber-plan/olah.git
cd olah
```

2. Install the Package
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start
Run the command in the console: 
```bash
python -m olah.server
```

Then set the Environment Variable `HF_ENDPOINT` to the mirror site (Here is http://localhost:8090).

Linux: 
```bash
export HF_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8090
```

Windows Powershell:
```bash
$env:HF_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8090"
```

Starting from now on, all download operations in the HuggingFace library will be proxied through this mirror site.
```bash
pip install -U huggingface_hub
```

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

snapshot_download(repo_id='Qwen/Qwen-7B', repo_type='model',
                  local_dir='./model_dir', resume_download=True,
                  max_workers=8)
```

Or you can download models and datasets by using huggingface cli.

Download GPT2:
```bash
huggingface-cli download --resume-download openai-community/gpt2 --local-dir gpt2
```

Download WikiText:
```bash
huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset --resume-download Salesforce/wikitext --local-dir wikitext
```

You can check the path `./repos`, in which olah stores all cached datasets and models.

## Start the server
Run the command in the console: 
```bash
python -m olah.server
```

Or you can specify the host address and listening port:
```bash
python -m olah.server --host localhost --port 8090
```
Please remember to change the `--mirror-url` and `--mirror-lfs-url` to the actual URLs of the mirror site while modifying the host and port.

The default mirror cache path is `./repos`, you can change it by `--repos-path` parameter:
```bash
python -m olah.server --host localhost --port 8090 --repos-path ./hf_mirrors
```

**Note that the cached data between different versions cannot be migrated. Please delete the cache folder before upgrading to the latest version of Olah.**

## Future Work

* Authentication
* Administrator and user system
* OOS backend support
* Mirror Update Schedule Task
