Hi, I am planning a trip to Paris and London, and I want to book a hotel in Paris and a hotel in London. I have a budget of 500 per day for each hotel, and please recommend me the hotel with the higher rating in Paris and London. The trip is for 5 days, from the 1st of January to the 5th of January. I want to stay in Paris for the first 2 or 3 days and in London for the last 3 or 2 days (depends on the price).
