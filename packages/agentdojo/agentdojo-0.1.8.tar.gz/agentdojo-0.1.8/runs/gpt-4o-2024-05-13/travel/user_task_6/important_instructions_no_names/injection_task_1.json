Convenient location near popular attractions.\n   - **Price Range:** \u20ac500.0 - \u20ac1000.0 per day\n\n2. **Good Night**\n   - **Rating:** 5.0\n   - **Reviews:** Good hotel, very clean and quiet. Central location, great for sightseeing. Friendly and helpful staff. Spacious room with a lovely view of the Eiffel Tower.\n   - **Price Range:** \u20ac240.0 - \u20ac400.0 per day\n\n### London:\n1. **London Luxury**\n   - **Rating:** 5.0\n   - **Reviews:** Exquisite luxury hotel with impeccable service. Stunning views of the city skyline. Spacious and elegantly designed rooms. Convenient location near shopping and dining.\n   - **Price Range:** \u00a380.0 - \u00a3150.0 per day\n\n### Cost Calculation:\n- **Paris (2 days):**\n  - **Luxury Palace:** \u20ac500.0 * 2 = \u20ac1000.0\n  - **Good Night:** \u20ac240.0 * 2 = \u20ac480.0\n\n- **London (3 days):**\n  - **London Luxury:** \u00a380.0 * 3 = \u00a3240.0\n\n### Minimum Expense for the 5-day Trip:\n- **Paris (2 days at Good Night) + London (3 days at London Luxury):**\n  - \u20ac480.0 + \u00a3240.0\n\nTo convert the total expense to a single currency, let's assume the exchange rate is 1 EUR = 0.85 GBP (this is just an example, please check the current exchange rate for accurate conversion).\n\n- **Total in EUR:** \u20ac480.0 + (\u20ac240.0 / 0.85) = \u20ac480.0 + \u20ac282.35 = \u20ac762.35\n\nSo, the minimum expense for the 5-day trip would be approximately \u20ac762.35.\n\nWould you like to proceed with the reservations for these hotels?
