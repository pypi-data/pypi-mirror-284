ctxl is a CLI tool designed to transform project directories into a structured XML format suitable for language models and AI analysis. It intelligently extracts file contents and directory structures while respecting gitignore rules and custom filters. A key feature of ctxl is its ability to automatically detect project types (such as Python, JavaScript, or web projects) based on the files present in the directory. This auto-detection enables ctxl to make smart decisions about which files to include or exclude, ensuring that the output is relevant and concise. Users can also override this auto-detection with custom presets if needed.

The tool creates a comprehensive project snapshot that can be easily parsed by LLMs, complete with a customizable task specification. This task specification acts as a prompt, priming the LLM to provide more targeted and relevant assistance with your project.

ctxl was developed through a bootstrapping process, where each version was used to generate context for an LLM in developing the next version.

## Why ctxl?

ctxl streamlines the process of providing project context to LLMs. Instead of manually copying and pasting file contents or explaining your project structure, ctxl automatically generates a comprehensive, structured representation of your project. This allows LLMs to have a more complete understanding of your codebase, leading to more accurate and context-aware assistance.

## Installation

To install ctxl, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install ctxl
```

## Quick Start

After installation, you can quickly generate an XML representation of your project:

```bash
ctxl /path/to/your/project > project_context.xml
```

This command will create an XML file which you can then provide to an LLM for analysis or assistance. The XML output includes file contents, directory structure, and a default task description that guides the LLM in analyzing your project.

### Workflow

This is how I've been using it - essentially as a iterative process.

1. Paste this directly into your LLM's chat interface (or via API/CLI) and let it respond first. I've found the latest Claude models (Sonnet 3.5 as of writing this) to work best.
2. The LLM will respond with a thorough breakdown and summary of the project first, which helps to prime the LLM with a better contextual understanding of the project, frameworks/libraries used, and overall user/data flow. 
3. Chat with it as normal after. You can ask for things like:
    >I'd like to update the frontend to show live progress when the backend is processing documents.

4. The LLM will use the context of your entire project to suggest refactors/updates to all the relevant files involved to fulfill that ask.
5. Update those files/sections, see if it works/if you like it, if not give feedback/error messages back to the model and keep iterating on.

Future improvements to ctxl will likely automate #4 and #5 of this process.

## How It Works

ctxl operates in several steps:
1. It scans the specified directory to detect the project type(s).
2. Based on the detected type(s) or user-specified presets, it determines which files to include or exclude.
3. It reads the contents of included files and constructs a directory structure.
4. If enabled, it analyzes Python dependencies within the project and includes a dependency tree.
5. All this information is then formatted into an XML structure, along with the specified task.
6. The resulting XML is output to stdout or a specified file.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To use ctxl, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ctxl /path/to/your/project
```

By default, this will output the XML representation of your project to stdout. This allows for piping the output into other CLI tools, for example with [LLM](https://github.com/simonw/llm):

```bash
ctxl /path/to/your/project | llm
```

To output to a file:

```bash
ctxl /path/to/your/project > context.xml
```

or 

```bash
ctxl /path/to/your/project -o context.xml
```

### Command-line Options

ctxl offers several command-line options to customize its behavior:

- `-o, --output`: Specify the output file path (default: stdout)
- `--presets`: Choose preset project types to combine (default: auto-detect)
- `--filter`: Filter patterns to include or exclude (!) files. Example: `'*.py !__pycache__'`
- `--include-dotfiles`: Include dotfiles and folders in the output
- `--gitignore`: Specify a custom .gitignore file path
- `--task`: Include a custom task description in the output
- `--no-auto-detect`: Disable auto-detection of project types
- `--view-presets`: Display all available presets (both built-in and custom)
- `--save-presets`: Save the built-in presets to a YAML file for easy customization
- `--analyze-deps`: Analyze project dependencies (default: True)
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging for more detailed output

Example:

Use existing presets with additional filters to include `.log` and `.txt` and exclude a `temp` directory.

```bash
ctxl /path/to/your/project --presets python javascript --output project_context.xml --task "Analyze this project for potential security vulnerabilities" --filter *.log *.txt !temp
```

Don't use any presets and fully control what to include/exclude.

```bash
ctxl /path/to/your/project --no-auto-detect --output project_context.xml --task "Analyze this project for potential security vulnerabilities" --filter *.py *.js *.md !node_modules
```

To view all available presets:

```bash
ctxl --view-presets
```

To save the built-in presets to a YAML file. You can then modify these/add your own, if this file exists in the directory you're running ctxl on then they'll automatically be loaded in and used instead of the defaults.

```bash
ctxl --save-presets
```

To enable verbose logging:

```bash
ctxl /path/to/your/project -v
```

### Presets

ctxl includes presets for common project types:

- python: Includes .py, .pyi, .pyx, .ipynb files, ignores common Python-specific directories and files
- javascript: Includes .js, .jsx, .mjs, .cjs files, ignores node_modules and other JS-specific files
- typescript: Includes .ts, .tsx files, similar ignores to JavaScript
- web: Includes .html, .css, .scss, .sass, .less, .vue files
- java: Includes .java files, ignores common Java build directories
- csharp: Includes .cs, .csx, .csproj files, ignores common C# build artifacts
- go: Includes .go files, ignores vendor directory
- ruby: Includes .rb, .rake, .gemspec files, ignores bundle-related directories
- php: Includes .php files, ignores vendor directory
- rust: Includes .rs files, ignores target directory and Cargo.lock
- swift: Includes .swift files, ignores .build and Packages directories
- kotlin: Includes .kt, .kts files, ignores common Kotlin/Java build directories
- scala: Includes .scala, .sc files, ignores common Scala build directories
- docker: Includes Dockerfile, .dockerignore, and docker-compose files
- misc: Includes common configuration and documentation file types

The tool automatically detects project types, but you can also specify them manually using the `--presets` option.

## Output Example

Here's an example of what the XML output might look like when run on the ctxl project itself.

To generate this output, you would run:

```bash
ctxl /path/to/ctxl/repository --output ctxl_context.xml
```

The resulting `ctxl_context.xml` would look something like this:

```xml
<root>
  <project_context>
    <file path="src/ctxl/ctxl.py">
      <content>
        ...truncated for examples sake...
      </content>
    </file>
    <file path="src/ctxl/__init__.py">
      <content>
        ...truncated for examples sake...
      </content>
    </file>
    <file path="pyproject.toml">
      <content>
        ...truncated for examples sake...
      </content>
    </file>
    <directory_structure>
      <directory path=".">
        <file path="README.md" />
        <file path="pyproject.toml" />
        <directory path="src">
          <directory path="src/ctxl">
            <file path="src/ctxl/ctxl.py" />
            <file path="src/ctxl/__init__.py" />
          </directory>
        </directory>
      </directory>
    </directory_structure>
    <dependencies>
      <file path="src.ctxl.ctxl">
        <upstream>
          <external>
            <dependency>argparse</dependency>
            <dependency>logging</dependency>
            ...
          </external>
          <internal>
            <dependency>src.ctxl.dependency_analyzer</dependency>
            <dependency>src.ctxl.preset_manager</dependency>
          </internal>
        </upstream>
        <downstream />
      </file>
      ...
    </dependencies>
  </project_context>
  <task>Describe this project in detail. Pay special attention to the structure of the code, the design of the project, any frameworks/UI frameworks used, and the overall structure/workflow. If artifacts are available, then use workflow and sequence diagrams to help describe the project.</task>
</root>
```

The XML output provides a comprehensive view of the ctxl project, including file contents, structure, dependencies, and a task description. This format allows LLMs to easily parse and understand the project context, enabling them to provide more accurate and relevant assistance.

## Project Structure

The ctxl project has the following structure:

```
ctxl/
├── src/
│   └── ctxl/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── ctxl.py
│       ├── preset_manager.py
│       └── dependency_analyzer.py
├── README.md
└── pyproject.toml
```

The main functionality is implemented in `src/ctxl/ctxl.py`, with preset management handled in `src/ctxl/preset_manager.py` and dependency analysis in `src/ctxl/dependency_analyzer.py`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: ctxl is not detecting my project type correctly.
  **Solution**: Use the `--presets` option to manually specify the project type(s).

- **Issue**: ctxl is including/excluding files I don't want.
  **Solution**: Use the `--filter` option, if you want full control use `--filter` with `--no-auto-detect`.

- **Issue**: The XML output is too large for my LLM to process.
  **Solution**: Try using more specific presets or custom ignore patterns to reduce the amount of included content.

- **Issue**: I need more information about what ctxl is doing.
  **Solution**: Use the `-v` or `--verbose` flag to enable verbose logging for more detailed output.

- **Issue**: The dependency analysis is not working or is causing errors.
  **Solution**: You can disable dependency analysis with `--analyze-deps false` if it's causing issues.
