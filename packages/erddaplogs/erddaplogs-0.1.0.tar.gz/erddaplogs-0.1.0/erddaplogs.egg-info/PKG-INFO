[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

A package for analysing traffic to an ERDDAP server by parsing nginx and apache logs.

Try it out on Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/callumrollo/erddaplogs/HEAD?labpath=weblogs-parse-demo.ipynb)

### Installation

* #### From pypi, using pip

```sh
pip install erddaplogs
```

#### From conda-forge

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge erddaplogs
```

* #### From the repo, using pip

```sh
#First, clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/callumrollo/erddaplogs.git
cd erddaplogs
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt # install the dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Example usage


First, get the logs copied locally to a directory you can read and unzip them. e.g.:

```bash
rsync /var/log/nginx/* logs
gzip -dfr * logs
```
Next, run erddaplogs

```python
from erddaplogs.logparse import ErddapLogParser

parser = ErddapLogParser()
parser.load_nginx_logs("example_data/nginx_example_logs/") # replace with the path to your logs
parser.parse_datasets_xml("example_data/datasets.xml") # replace with the path to your xml, or remove this line
parser.filter_non_erddap()
parser.filter_spam()
parser.filter_locales()
parser.filter_user_agents()
parser.filter_common_strings()
parser.get_ip_info()
parser.filter_organisations()
parser.parse_columns()
parser.export_data(output_dir=".") # Put the path to the output dir here. Preferably somewhere your ERDDAP can read
```

This will read nginx logs from the user specified directory and write two files `<timestamp>_anonymized_requests.csv` and `<timestamp>_aggregated_locations.csv` with anonymized requests and aggregated location data respectively. 

ErddapLogParser can be run on a static directory of logs or as a cron job e.g. once per day. If run repeatedly, it will create a new file for `anonymized_requests` with only anonymized requests that have been received since the script was last run. The `aggregated_locations` file will be updated with the new request locations, only one file with cumulative location totals is retained. 

To re-analyze all the input requests, first delete the output files in `output_dir` then re-run.

Optionally, the resulting anonymized data can be shared on your ERDDAP in two datasets `requests` and `locations`. To do this, add the contents of the example xml files `requests.xml` and `locations.xml` from the `example_data` directory to your `datasets.xml`. Make sure to update the entries for **fileDir** and **institution**. The other fields can remain as-is.

You can see what the resulting stats look like on the VOTO ERDDAP server:

- https://erddap.observations.voiceoftheocean.org/erddap/tabledap/locations.html
 
For more analysis options and plots, see the example jupyter notebook

### Example Jupyter Notebook

You can find an example Jupyter Notebook `weblogs-parse-demo.ipynb` in the `notebooks` directory. It performs the following steps:

1. Reads in apache and nginx logs, combine them into one consistent dataframe
2. Find the ips that made the greatest number of requests. Get their info from ip-api.com
3. Remove suspected spam/bot requests
4. Classify user data by identifying user agents, matching requets to dataset type etc.
5. Perform basic analysis to graph number of requests and users over time, most popular datasets/datatypes and geographic distribution of users
6. Anonymize user data and write them to file

A rather out od date blog post explaining this notebook in more detail can be found at [https://callumrollo.com/weblogparse.html](https://callumrollo.com/weblogparse.html)

A second notebook called `analyze_anonymized_usage` shows some examples of plotting the anonymized datasets made available on the VOTO ERDDAP

### A note on example data

If you don't have your own ERDDAP logs to hand, you can use the example data in `example_data/nginx_example_logs`. This is anonymized data from a production ERDDAP server [erddap.observations.voiceoftheocean.org](https://erddap.observations.voiceoftheocean.org/erddap). The ip addresses have been randomly generated, as have the user agents. All subscription emails have been replaced with fake@example.com
