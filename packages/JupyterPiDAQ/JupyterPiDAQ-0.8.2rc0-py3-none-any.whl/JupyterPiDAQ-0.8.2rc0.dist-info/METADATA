### [Website/Documentation](https://jupyterphysscilab.github.io/JupyterPiDAQ/)

### Introduction:
This software allows GUI (Graphical User Interface) driven live collection, 
plotting and analysis of 
digitized data inside a Jupyter notebook. The package was initially developed
to provide an inexpensive laboratory system for teaching based on
the Raspberry Pi.  **However, it now works on other hardware**. 
Presently the working combinations are:

**on Raspberry Pis** 
* Adafruit compliant ADS1115 boards 
([example](https://www.amazon.com/KNACRO-4-Channel-Raspberry-ADS1115-Channel/dp/B07149WH7P),
also available from other vendors);
* The [&pi;-Plates DAQC2 plate](https://pi-plates.com/daqc2r1/).

**on Macs and Windows**
* [Vernier](https://www.vernier.com) LabQuest USB A-to-Ds.

**demo mode on anything Jupyter runs on**
* A demo mode will run on any computer with a Jupyter notebook install and
Python 3.6+. You can try the demo mode without installing on your own 
  computer by launching an instance on the MyBinder servers:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JupyterPhysSciLab/JupyterPiDAQ.git/HEAD?urlpath=/tree/usage_examples)
  
The goal is for the user interface to be as close to self-explanatory as
 possible. However, documentation is being developed along with some example
  experiments.

##### Sensors:
Like many commercial educational packages the software knows about the
properties of some sensors, so can collect data directly in the units
appropriate for the sensor, in addition to the raw voltage signal returned
by the sensor. Not all sensors are compatible with all boards.
The developer(s) attempt to keep this list of known sensors up-to-date, but the
code may provide additional sensors not listed here:
* **ADS1115 compatible** (board can provide 3.3 V of power/reference to
 sensors):
  * voltage reading (V, mV) from any sensor that puts out a voltage in the
   range +/-3.3 V.
  * built-in thermistor (V, mV, K, C, F).
  * Vernier SS temperature probe (V, mV, K, C, F).
  
* **DAQC2 compatible** (board can provide 5.0 V of power/reference to sensors):
  * voltage reading (V, mV) from any sensor that puts out a voltage in the
   range +/- 12 V.
  * Vernier SS temperature probe (V, mV, K, C, F).
  * Vernier old and new pressure sensors (V, Pa, kPa, Bar, Torr, mmHg, atm)  
  * Vernier standard pH probe (V, mV, pH).
  * Vernier flat (tris compatible) pH probe (V, mV, pH).
  * Compatible with standard Vernier analog probes. Default calibrations
  being added as time and sensors become available.
  
* **LabQuest compatible** (board provides 5.0 V of power/reference to sensors):
  * voltage reading (V, mV) from any sensor that puts out a voltage in the
   range +/- 10 V.
  * Vernier SS temperature probe (V, mV, K, C, F).
  * Vernier old and new pressure sensors (V, Pa, kPa, Bar, Torr, mmHg, atm)  
  * Vernier standard pH probe (V, mV, pH).
  * Vernier flat (tris compatible) pH probe (V, mV, pH).
  * Compatible with standard Vernier analog probes. Default calibrations
  being added as time and sensors become available.
  
With any of these interfaces, you can hook up your own sensors and 
manually convert the raw voltage readings or write and submit a new sensor 
definition to the project.
